# OctoAcme Project Management Process Documentation

This directory contains OctoAcme's project management process guides. These docs help teams deliver customer-focused projects using iterative delivery, clear ownership, and data-informed decisions. They provide essential context for team members and can be added to `.copilot/` to enable Copilot Spaces to use them as guidance.

## Core Processes

- **Initiation**: Define problem statement, stakeholders, success metrics, and initial timeline
- **Planning**: Establish scope, resources, milestones, and dependencies
- **Execution & Tracking**: Manage day-to-day work with standups, sprints, and progress tracking
- **Release & Deployment**: Deploy, verify, and announce releases with quality gates
- **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement**: Capture learnings and iterate on processes
- **Risk & Communication**: Manage risks, dependencies, and stakeholder updates
- **Roles & Personas**: Define responsibilities for Project Managers, Product Managers, Developers, and QA
